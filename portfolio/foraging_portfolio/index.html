      What is Foraging?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Foraging is the act of searching for wild foods growing in nature. A forager might take expeditions into a pine forest to find mushrooms and NZ spinach, both of which I've seen growing on Mt. Victoria. Another might search for kawakawa and nettles for herbal teas.<br>
      Foraging is a great way to find tasty and healthy foods for very little cost. Foods can be found in many places, from rural areas and forests to urban areas, like paths and cracks in the pavement.<br>
      I have found wild carrots, blackberries, chickweed and watercress on the hill overlooking my childhood home in suburban Wellington. In Greytown, where I live now, Papawai's roads are lined with self-seeded wild plums and prickly pear. All of these are free and good to eat, and I advise you to take advantage of this.

    <h2>
      Why Forage?
    </h2>
    <p>
      As food prices rise across the globe, with organic foods expensive already, it is important to find a way to support you and your health. Foraging is a great way to do this, by finding unspoiled, natural foods that are good for you.<br>
      Plants like wild carrot and nettles are undomesticated, and so have higher nutrient contents than domestic carrots and spinach respectively. When these plants were domesticated, they were modified to bear more crop, at some loss of nutrients. This is why I try to incorporate wild foods into my diet, and why you should too.<br>
      There are foods that you don't often find in stores as well. <br>
      Fennel, a plant that, frankly, grows like the weed it is, has pollen which is an expensive and useful spice, and its delicious seeds have a licorice-like punch to them when chewed. <br>
      We all know about Kawakawa tea, but did you know the fruits have a sweet peppery taste and are great in salads or relishes? <br>
      Sorrel, Dandelion, Chickweed and Miner's Lettuce are all delicious salads that can be foraged.

    <h2>
      Where can I forage? 
    </h2>
    <p>
      When you begin foraging, you will start seeing soups and salads everywhere. Anywhere that plants are growing without human influence are free game, such as: 
      <ul>
        <li>Sides of bushwalks, or tracks like the Remutaka Incline</li>
        <li>Forest edges in the river</li>
        <li>Parks and green spaces</li>
        <li>Woodlands and Bushes, such as on Mt. Victoria in Wellington</li>
      </ul>
      Any of these places are great for finding wild foods. <br>
      However, some areas have laws against the gathering of specific plants in certain areas. <br>
      Do also be aware that many wild foods are quite sensitive to heavy metals and toxic substances and soak them up well. <br>
      In a garden, they can help to clean the soil, but in a city, if the ground has been sprayed, will transfer those toxins into mine. <br>
      I once heard of a great patch of nettles which grew on the ground where sheep dipping was run. The nettles had soaked up all the chemicals from the dipping. <br>
      Just know what's been where with foraging, and your dinners become healthier, tastier, cheaper and more interesting very quickly.

    <h2>Medicine?</h2>
    <p>
      Wild Greens, such as dandelion, nettle, lemon balm, yarrow and chickweed are a great source of nutrients, as they contain much higher nutrient densities than their domestic counterparts. They are also very healthy, and can be eaten as a snack or as part of a meal, such as a salad.<br>
      Lots of wild plants can be used restoratively as a natural ward against infection and disease. By taking these as part of your diet, you naturally boost your immune system and empower it to fight disease instead of merely stopping the symptoms, as mainstream allopathic medicine does.<br>
      This is due to the absence of an artificial domestication on the part of humans. This process reinforces traits that humans value (sweetness over bitterness, size, colour, disease resistance), and can slowly decrease other traits (nutrient content, )

    <h2>Which plants?</h2>
    <p>
      Lots of unnoticed plants have secret super powers once steeped in a tea or chewed on vigourously. <br>
      Lemon balm has calming properties, and can help you sleep easier. Comfrey, used topically helps to heal injuries (however, consumption is not advised, as it contains toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids). you'll realise that plants mentioned in other pages on this site, such as chickweed and nettles do have medicinal values, once you think about their nutrient content. <br>
      Yarrow is a power herb, with styptic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, antiseptic and antispasmodic properties. It also promotes digestion, lowers blood pressure and is a great general immune booster, with high levels in vitamin C, niacin etc.<br>
      It grows like the weed it is, and covers huge amounts of land in the Wairarapa, such as the grassy areas along the Remutaka Incline bike track.

    <h2>How can I use them?</h2>
    <p>
      Harvesting wild plants and using them in teas, tinctures and other forms of preservation can help your immune system cope on its own. You can harvest wild plants not just for vase decoration, or even food value, but simply for the benefits your body can reap from the natural world. <br>
      On another note, these medicinal herbs are not just medicine for your body, but also your garden. Add them to your compost pile, or chop and drop as mulch around your garden (if they germinate, even better; now you have on hand goodness depositing straight into your soil!)

  <section>
    Wild Greens, such as dandelion, nettle and chickweed are a great source of nutrients, as they contain much higher nutrient densities than their domestic counterparts. This makes them very healthy, and many of them can be eaten as part of a meal, herbal tea, or preserve.

      <h3>
        Nettles
      </h3>
      <p>
        Stinging nettles, while not the most comfortable to eat raw, are a great substitute for spinach. The spiky hairs which inject neurotoxins are destroyed by cooking, and they contain high amounts of iron, magnesium, vitamins C, K and D.<br>
        They are most often found in shady areas where manure or bones have been buried. Beware of areas that have possibly been sprayed, because nettles soak up toxins like an incredibly painful sponge.<br>
        Pick before they flower, using only the soft, green leaves at the top of the stalks.

      <h3>
        Miner's Lettuce
      </h3>
      <p>
        Miner's Lettuce is a truly delicious leafy green that grows anywhere from the shady corners or your garden to streetsides. Also known as winter purslane, this is a small cluster-like salading with small meaty leaves on a stalks coming up from the base. In summer, flowers appear in the centre of the leaves.<br>
        It's a great salad green, with the leaves picked from the base at any time of the year. You could eat it with a loose-leaf salad with chickweed, borage flowers and dandelion greens if you like.

      <h3>
        Chickweed
      </h3>
      <p>
        Chickweed is quite similar to Miner's Lettuce in texture and taste, and it often grows nearby, but it grows in a matt of leaves rather than a clump of stems.<br>
        However, the plant's lookalike, spurge, is toxic. The difference is that spurge grows in a bushier manner, rather than a mat, has no hair on the stems, and has tiny green flowers instead of white ones.<br>
        Chickweed is choc full of minerals and vitamins, so don't waste any you have left over, chuck it in the compost with all the other wild greens you have left over.

      <h3>
        Wild Carrot
      </h3>
      <p>
        I have a soft spot for Wild Carrot. It was pretty much the first thing I consciously "foraged". I had read a book on it previously, and then while I was walking through the bush on the way back from school one day, I recognized it. I pulled it up and brought it to some, to be honest, confused parents.<br>
        It can be differentiated from its lookalike Hemlock (extremely poisonous, be very sure with this) by Hemlock's purple blotches on the stem, much fernier leaves, and lack of carrot smell on the root. (if it smells like carrot root, you're all good). Make sure to be 100% sure, otherwise it won't be fun.<br>
        Wild Carrot is stringier and more fibrous, and should be picked before it flowers, then boil to cook. The seeds have a pleasant aniseedy flavour when chewed.

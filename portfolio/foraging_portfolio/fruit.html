    <p>
      Probably one of the most popular things to forage because of their inherent deliciousness and versatility, wild fruits are a great thing to look for anywhere you go.<br>
      Wild fruit, while often less sweet and refined, the fruit often contains - like other foraged foods - higher levels of vitamin C, antioxidants and other good stuff. <br>
      I will include tree nuts within this section.

      <h3>
        Plums
      </h3>
      <p>
        One of my all time favourite fruits, both foraged and normal, plums can be found nearly anywhere, from the center of Featherston to sunny roadsides all around the South Wairarapa. Smaller than domestic plums, these trees have small green fruits which turn bright red or yellow in late January or early February. <br>
        Trees could bear anything from small, smooth fruit with a watery taste to medium-sized, speckled, meaty fruit with a tart flavour. Remember to try a few before filling your basket.<br>

      <h3>
        Blackberries
      </h3>
      <p>
        A foraging classic, found on roadsides and pretty much anywhere the soil has been disturbed.<br>
        Everybody knows what to do with blackberries: eat fresh, jam (with crab apples or hawthorn berries for the pectin), or bake into pies (my personal favorite).<br>
        Be aware that your local council may spray the roadside blackberries in your area, so know the signs: shrivelled leaves, blackened foliage and tiny shrivelled fruit give a likely sprayed plant away.<br>

      <h3>
        Hawthorn
      </h3>
      <p>
        Hawthorn is a small bushy tree with thick thorned branches and small lobed leaves. The white flowers bloom in spring, and turn to bright red fruit with a large pip in late summer and autumn.<br>
        Hawthorns should have their seeds removed, as they contain cyanide. You can make a good hawthorn jam, jelly with the crushed flesh, as they have a very high pectin count. Using hawthorns as a pectin source, you can make a great berry jam.<br>
        Hawthorns can be found along pretty much any roadside east of Greytown or Carterton.<br>

      <h3>
        Sweet Chestnuts
      </h3>
      <p>
        Chestnuts are a great tool in a forager's belt. Containing about the same carbs and nutrition as the same weight of rice, and with a pleasant taste close to kumara, sweet chestnuts are a delicious autumn staple.<br>
        When the nuts ripen in late autumn, the will fall to the ground in their spiky shells. Pry the nuts free and take them home. Allow them to dry for a few weeks, and then boil or roast until soft with the shells slit to allow the warm nut to cook and expand.<br>
        Chestnuts are quite a large tree, so you can get quite a yield off one. The only danger is their toxic lookalike, horse chestnut. Horse chestnuts almost always fall to the ground free of their casings, are much larger (about twice the size of a sweet chestnut) and their leaves are large, pinnate with 5 fingers and are arrowhead / teardrop shaped.<br>
        Sweet chestnuts' leaves are glossy and separate, coming off the bark in alternating pairs, and their leaves are a feather-like shape.<br>

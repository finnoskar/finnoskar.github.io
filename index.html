      <h2>What is this page?</h2>
      <p>This is a website I made to collate my projects and involvements using CSS, JS, and HTML.<br>I've stored information on my python Habit Tracking App StreakIt, my FLORIS flowermaking program, my website on foraging, my musical interests and band, Shuttle.</p>
      <p>I plan to leave this code open source as a possible resource for others to clone and display their own achievements, or collate the achievements of others.</p>

          <h2>Programming</h2>
          <p>
            Through my digitech classes at school, I've worked on a few projects, including a Python flower-making program, a website on foraging, and a habit tracking app called Streak It.
          </p>
          <h4>Why</h4>
          <p>I've always been really interested with web development and computer science, possibly fueled by a perennial frustration of IT. How I can go from implementing parallax and animation to failing miserably to crop an image is a mystery.</p>
          <h4>What</h4>
          <p>Here I'll supply a bio of each of my projects; their intentions, uses, and downloads if one wished to experiment with it.</p>

          <h2>Music</h2>
          <p>
            I've been a part of the Wairarapa band Shuttle for over a year now. <br>
            We've recorded one song, performed two, and are working on three more compositions.
          </p>
          <h4>Our Music</h4>
          <p>With vox, keys, bass and guitar, we've written several songs that explore the nature of society and the pressures placed by it on people trying to live an ordinary life.</p>
          <p>With influences from all over, we're working on branching out to more creative avenues and experimenting with more artistic song forms.</p>
